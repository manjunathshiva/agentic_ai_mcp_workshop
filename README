This repository contains a collection of agent implementations for a workshop. Each agent demonstrates different capabilities and integration patterns.

### Agents

1.  **7-Day Weather Agent (`7dayagent`)**
    *   **Description:** A Python-based agent that provides a 7-day weather forecast for a specified city.
    *   **Implementation:** This agent uses a mock data source to generate weather forecasts, making it a good example of a simple, self-contained agent. It's built using the Google ADK.

2.  **Airbnb Agent (`airbnb`)**
    *   **Description:** A Python-based agent designed to interact with an Airbnb-like service.
    *   **Implementation:** This agent uses the `MCPToolset` to connect to an external service, showcasing how to integrate agents with other platforms.

3.  **Custom MCP Agent (`custommcp`)**
    *   **Description:** A helpful assistant that can greet users and perform calculations.
    *   **Implementation:** This agent utilizes a `Greeting Tool` and a `Calculator Tool` through the `MCPToolset`, demonstrating how to combine multiple tools within a single agent.

4.  **DuckDuckGo Search Agent (`ducksearch`)**
    *   **Description:** A Python-based agent capable of performing web searches using the DuckDuckGo search engine.
    *   **Implementation:** It connects to a search service via the `MCPToolset`, providing a practical example of an agent that can access real-world information.

### Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for all agents.
*   **Google ADK:** The framework used to build and structure the agents.
*   **MCP (Model-Centric Protocol):** Used for communication between agents and external tools/services.

### How to Run

1.  **Set up the environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run an Agent:** Navigate to the directory of the agent you want to run and execute the `adk web` command. For example, to run the weather agent:
    ```bash
    cd 7dayagent
    adk web
    ```
